  <h1>WCA Teams and Committees</h1>

  <p>The WCA's teams and committees are an integral part of the organization and perform the day-to-day tasks that are required to keep it functioning. These committees are made up of WCA community members, including Delegates and competitors. Each team has a leader, whose role is to ensure the proper functioning of the team and guide other team members. When there are committee openings, information about how to apply is posted on the front page.</p>

  <h3>WCA Officers</h3>
  <p>The officers of the WCA handle tasks relating to the non-profit status of the WCA. These officers are elected by the WCA Board. The Executive Director is the Chief Executive Officer of the WCA, the Chair presides over all Board meetings, the Secretary maintains the organization\'s documents, and the Treasurer manages financial matters of the WCA.</p>
